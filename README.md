## Disclaimer
This project makes use of [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) (included in ./lib/) and some browser-native JavaScript tools.  
  
## Overview
**md2dom** is a lightweight, browser-based tool that converts Markdown into clean, self-contained HTML ready to be hosted as webpages.  
Try the live version here: [md2dom.elinlyze.com](https://md2dom.elinlyze.com/)

## Community and Collaboration
**md2dom** is open source because the web should stay open.  
You’re invited to fork it, modify it, or integrate its logic into your own tools.  
Contributions, issues, and discussion are always welcome, improvements grow best in the open.

## A Note on Development
This project was created with a lot of curiosity, patience, and even some help from AI tools along the way for code clarity (sorry).  
I’m not an HTML, JS or frontend expert. **md2dom** is the result of learning by doing, experimenting and the help of people much smarter than me.  
  
If you spot issues, have ideas for improvements or just want to help make it cleaner, I’d love your feedback and contributions.  
Every suggestion helps make this a better little open-source utility.
